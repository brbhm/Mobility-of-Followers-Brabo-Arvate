Welcome to the Repository of Files for the paper "Is the mobility of followers explained by dissimilarity/similarity of ideology in leader-follower dyads?", written by Henrique Brabo and Paulo Arvate.
Any doubts or inquires, please send an e-mail to paulo.arvate@fgv.br (corresponding Author) or henrique.brabo@fgv.edu.br

The Do-files presented here were developed using Stata 17-MP64, in a 32GB RAM computer.

* ##################### Navegating in the Repository
The current repository consists mainly in two folders. The first one is regarding the Do-files. The main do-file ("Mobility of Followers") also runs all the other do-files and even install the necessary packages.
So, with all the do-files downloaded (as well as the database), you should be able to replicate all findings and results

* ##################### Disclaimer About the Dataset
The dataset mainly consists in data from political party affiliations and electoral candidate characteristcs from Brazil. This dataset used to be publicly available but was removed from public access due to the LGPD ("Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados"), the data protection law (similar to the GDPR). This is the reason that the researchers are not allowed to share the original versions (identified or identifiable) of those datasets. The same applies for the RAIS database.
If you have access to the original dataset (tables with the least of individuals filiated to each political party, by year and state), we are glad to check if the sample is similar to ours, and we would clearly help replicating the construction of the consolidated databases.

* ##################### Downloading the Dataset (consolidated)
Due to the size of the consolidated database, you should be able to download it from (https://1drv.ms/f/c/9339fddb08494cba/EuWWfGDlEqNEpLJBrH9OFTUBxvrhhXuHh1LXBxxjglPHFg?e=lfoYka). Password will be provided in the Cover Letter.

If you have any doubts or struggle to replicate the results, don't hesitate to contact us.
